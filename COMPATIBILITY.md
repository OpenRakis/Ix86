A lot of programs are not running.

This is mainly because:
 - Some VGA features are not implemented (eg. smooth scrolling).
 - Quite a lot of DOS kernel interrupts are not implemented.
 - TSR / sub programs / XMS is not implemented

Here is a list of old games I tested with what worked and what didn't:
